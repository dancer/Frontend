# **Football betting**

In this repo, we have our project, the backend (written in C#) and the frontend.

The backend can be started by `cd` ing into the `Frontend/Backend/Betting` and running `dotnet run`

The frontend can be run by installing node.js and then after installing the dependencies, `npm run`


**Previously, the development was in another repo:** [old-repo](https://github.com/iokitpusher/backend)
